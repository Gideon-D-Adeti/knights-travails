# Knights Travails

This project implements a function to determine the shortest path for a knight on a standard 8x8 chessboard from a starting position to a target position using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

## Description

The `knightMoves` function computes the shortest path a knight can take from one position to another on a chessboard. The knight's movement follows the standard chess rules: two steps in one direction and one step perpendicular to it, in any direction.

The project uses a BFS algorithm to explore the shortest path, ensuring that all possible paths are explored level by level to find the quickest route.
